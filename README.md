# ImageReaper

ImageReaper is a Chrome Extension (MV3) that scans web pages for supported image host links (e.g. ImageBam, Pixhost, etc.), resolves them to their direct image URLs, and downloads them to your computer with customizable save paths and filename prefixes.

## ‚ú® Features

  - Simple "Scan Page" button to start scanning the active tab.  
  - Opens a dedicated Results page with found links.

- **Results Page**  
  - Displays all viewer links from the scanned page.
